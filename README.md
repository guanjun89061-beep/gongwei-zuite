# Zuiti · 嘴替  
### The Open-Source AI Rant Companion for the Workplace  
*(English version · [中文版本点这里](README_CN.md))*

---

## 🌟 Overview

**Zuiti** is an open-source AI-powered “rant companion” designed for workplace stress relief.

When your boss suddenly says *“let’s realign the granularity and sync bottom-level logic”*  
(…even though they don’t know what they’re talking about),

Zuiti helps you translate that into:

> “They have no idea what they want. They just want you to work overtime until they feel powerful.”

This project is a fun, practical tool to:

- Vent emotions safely  
- Generate humorous, aggressive-but-clean rants  
- Mock workplace jargon  
- Role-play resignation speeches  
- Release workplace pressure without risking your job
